# Metal Fans Website

This project is an Astro-based website starter for metal music fans. Due to network restrictions in the development environment, Astro dependencies are not installed. After cloning the repository, run `npm install` in the `metal-fans-website` directory to fetch dependencies, then use `npm run dev` to start the site locally.
